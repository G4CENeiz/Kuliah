   abstract = {Over the last few years, Computer Science class sizes have increased, resulting in a higher grading workload. Universities often use multiple graders to quickly deliver the grades and associated feedback to manage this workload. While using multiple graders enables the required turnaround times to be achieved, it can come at the cost of consistency and feedback quality. Partially automating the process of grading and feedback could help solve these issues. This project will look into methods to assist in grading and feedback partially subjective elements of programming assignments, such as readability, maintainability, and documentation, to increase the marker’s amount of time to write meaningful feedback. We will investigate machine learning and natural language processing methods to improve grade uniformity and feedback quality in these areas. Furthermore, we will investigate how using these tools may allow instructors to include open-ended requirements that challenge students to use their ideas for possible features in their assignments.},
