\section*{Exercise 9}
In terms of meeting the minimum requirements for this position, I believe I am well-prepared based on my current experience and educational background. Although I may not yet have fulfilled every single requirement listed in the job advertisement, I am confident that by the time I graduate, I will have satisfied most, if not all, of these qualifications. Many of the skills and knowledge areas specified in the job description are integral to my current academic pursuits, and I am actively learning and developing these competencies through my coursework and projects. While there may be a few requirements that are not fully met immediately upon graduation, I anticipate that my forthcoming internship experiences will significantly enhance my qualifications and address any gaps left by my formal education.

The job description aligns perfectly with my career aspirations and the type of work I am eager to engage in. It appears that the position is designed to meet the high standards typically expected from graduates who complete higher education programs. Although it is rare for any graduate to fulfill every single expectation outlined in a job description exactly, the job listing sets a clear and ambitious benchmark for the role, which I find both inspiring and relevant to my career goals. I consider myself a good fit for this entry-level position, especially since the advertisement explicitly states that it is intended for candidates at the beginning of their professional careers. As a future graduate, I fully expect that entry-level roles are structured to accommodate individuals who are just starting out in their careers.

Moreover, the company’s focus on the banking sector is particularly appealing to me, given my deep interest in this field, which aligns closely with my Ikigai—a concept that reflects my sense of purpose and fulfillment. By the time I complete my degree, I will have met various qualifications necessary for this role. This job offers a valuable opportunity to work on subjects that I am passionate about while being compensated for my efforts. Additionally, individuals with an educational background similar to mine are likely to meet the qualifications for this position, highlighting the strong alignment between the job requirements and the education I am receiving. This role represents a promising match for my career objectives and supports my professional and personal development goals.
