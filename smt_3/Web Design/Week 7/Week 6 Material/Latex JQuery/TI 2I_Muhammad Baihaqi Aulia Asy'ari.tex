\begin{enumerate}
    \item The ready function make sure that every element it want to use is already diplayed and ready to be used.
    \item The selector works just like the css selector. The experiment give us example on how we use selector and what can we do with selector using JQuery action/function.
    \item The first selector point to the document object of the page. There the ready action execute a function that pointed by the selector to the element button. The button it self has the click action to execute a function in which it point to multiple element using tag, class, id, class and id combination, and tag, class, id combination. For each element selected inside the function, it has the action to hide said element.
    \item The CSS changes accordingly to the list of action of the id paragraf and its coresponding css changes.
    \item There are multiple action to hide or show an element. Not only that, an element can be animated with othe action that can hide and show by fading in and out. 
    \item The div with the id "kotak2" float up and disappear once the user clicked on the div with the id "flip".
    \item Now the div with the id "kotak2" appear by sliding down from under the div with the id "flip" after clicking on the "flip" div.
    \item Now each time we click on div with the id "kotak2", it toggles between toggle up and down.
    \item The div scoot to the left a certain amount (what can only be assume as 300 unit of css units e.g px, pt)
    \item The box stretches and move and changes attribute as the animation method dictate. It essentially modify the style of the selected element sequentially turning it into animation.
    \item Get text returns the text content of the selected element. Get HTML returns the HTML code inside the selected element. Get val returns the value from the selected input element.
    \item Set text write the Strings as a child text of the element. Set HTML write in the selected HTML. Set value put in a value inside the input.
    \item The tables are manipulated using a set function triggred by the click of the add-row button and a remove function triggred by the click of the delete-row button.
    \item We can add style to element by tagging class on an element or directly add the css to the element.
    \item The picture fade in and out in a same time interval. the picture changes from the 1st to 3rd and loop around.
    \item[15.] The input text became a dropdown date picker. Once the date has been picked, it became a date input in the input element.
    \item We've created accordion tab that we can fill with content using div or paragraph. it also can have images and list inside of them
    \item The HTML inside test-content load in the selected element after being triggred by the click from the button.
