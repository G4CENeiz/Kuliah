\chapter{Project Description}
    \section{Project Name}
    Information Technology Room Tenant System
    \section{Bussiness Needs}
    In the Informatics Department, There is a standard operating procedure to borrow a room for events such as seminars, workshops, etc. Despite having the standard operating procedure, the procedure itself is deemed unnecessarily complicated and tedious. This app is aimed to streamline the process of borrowing rooms in the JTI building.
    \section{Product Perspective}
    This app is made to reduce the amount of paperwork and administrative workload being done manually. The staff and faculty of JTI will use the app to manage the rooms and the events. The students will also use the app to book the rooms for their events. This app will also ensure the borrower's reserved room isn't being overridden by any third party or will clarify why the reserved room is being overridden if anything happened that has higher priority than the borrower's event. This app aims for bureaucracy transparency to minimize miscommunication and misunderstanding.
    \section{Project Scope}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
        \item In Scope
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
            \item The project is a web app that can be accessed by the admins of the inventory using a web browser.
            \item The app should have a basic authentication feature to ensure that only the authorized users can access the app.
            \item The app should be able to provide a way for the admins to manage the inventory, such as adding, removing, and updating the room and event data.
            \item The admin and student should be able to see the list of rooms and events.
            \item The app should be able to provide a way for the admins to manage the users, such as adding, removing, and updating the users.
            \item The app should provide a way for students to borrow a room from the list. Each room can only be borrowed for a certain amount of time.
            \item The admins should be able to see the history of the room borrowings.
            \item The app should never give an invalid state such as the start of the borrowing time is after the end of the borrowing time.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Out of Scope
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
            \item Integration with other systems, such as the university's student information system for Single Sign-On (SSO).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Application Logo Philosophy}
    The logo is taken from the logo of the information technology major from state polytechnic of malang itself. This logo is used because the app that we created is used for room tenant system to be used in the information technology. So we use the logo of the major itself to make it clear that the app that is being use is used for and belong to the information technology major.

            \item Ensure compliance with established policies and requirements.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{User flow for user}
    \noindent
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/figures/UIUX/Untitled 5.png}
    General Steps :
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Users access the room tenant system website
        \item To access website services, users need to log in first with the account they already have.
        \item The user already logged in to the system.
        \item At this point (home), the user can see the rooms available to borrow and three available menus.
        \item Users can directly select an available room at home or go to the room list menu to select the room they want to borrow.
        \item When the user has determined the room he wants to borrow, the user needs to fill in a borrow detail form consisting of the name of the event, date and time, as well as event details.
        \item Apart from filling in borrow details, users need to agree to the code of conduct of the relevant regulations and room.
        \item After everything has been filled in correctly by the user, the user can click the submit button to submit a request.
        \item The user has finished making a borrow request.
    \end{enumerate}
    Validation and Error Handling :
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item It happens on the login process, If the account credentials entered are correct then the user can log in and arrive at the home page. But when the credentials 5entered are incorrect, the user is asked to log in again and ensure that the credentials entered are correct.
        \item When a user has submitted a borrow request, when the system finds a borrow request on the same date and time in the room desired by the user, the system will ask the user to change the date and time that does not collide.
    \end{enumerate}
    Backtracking :\\
    Users can only abandon their intention to borrow the room they choose only when they have not submitted it. At the point where the user is asked to fill out a borrowed form, he can again use the back button to cancel the room selection.
    \subsection{User flow for admin}
    \noindent
